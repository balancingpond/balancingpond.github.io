On 28th November 2014 I walked from my parent's house in north London in a 
direct line due north for one mile or so. Following this transect, I noticed 
it cross right through a churchyard, and in fact right through the heart of a 
massive ancient oak tree. This is known as the 
[Minchenden Oak](http://www.minchendenoak.org/). Minchenden, I believe, is 
the old name of the area, derived from an old estate/family--the local school 
I attended as a child used also to be called Minchenden. The oak has stood on 
this site for hundreds of years and is considered holy by some (I included, 
not least due to the exact northern alignment with my childhood home).

After this, I continued north along the transect. This took me up into Trent 
Park, where I found a few sodden mushrooms, including these delicious 
shaggy-caps, and a throne.
