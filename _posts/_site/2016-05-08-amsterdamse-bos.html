<p>Sunday, hot. Despite cold, decide to step outside. Spent last night 
contemplating where to walk today. Considered one of Amsterdam’s three sewage 
farms (RWZI), preferably Amsterdam West, that being the most extensive. 
Probably too far. Then, noticed a near continuous stretch of green going from 
my place close to the banks of the Amstel, along Amstel, Amstel Park and out 
to Amsterdamse Bos.</p>

<p>Set off around 1pm, back around 7:30pm. Struck by the relaxed, fair-like and 
altogether quaint atmosphere of Amstel Pk. Quite busy, then step across 
<em>Roud Brug</em> and into the wonders of the 60s social housing of Amsterdam Zuid. 
Today it is like a ghost town - hardly a soul in site. The high white blocks 
are laid out around large open spaces - high boulevards of trees, waterways 
and planted walkways - a winning combination of prestressed concrete 
parkitecure and lush greenery. These deeply peaceful spaces fill me with the 
same sense of academic bliss as one finds in the most secluded of Cambridge 
college quadrangles. Onwards to the Bos. Lying before the entrance to the Bos 
from this approach are the highly decorated coffins of the Pharaohs of 
Amsterdamse Bos, the most notable of whom was Tootin’ Cartoon.</p>

<p>Reached the Bos, pass possible location of the nude spa (note for future 
reference), and head to the long long water of Bosbaan. I could watch the 
giant KLM planes taking off over the water for hours - blue planes in a blue 
blue sky over a deep blue water. I notice a heron perched close to the 
water’s edge. Another chance for the perfect heron shot. I know I will get it 
one day, perhaps today is that day? I’m crouching down, still, eye firm to 
the lense when I hear laughter from behind me. As I move away, it then dawns 
on me that the party behind think I’m taking shots of the topless woman 
sunbathing a few feet to the left. No! It’s the heron! Honest! Time to move 
on and hide my shame in the depths of the Bos…</p>

<p>…Following paths inwards, I notice a distinct area of raised ground on 
the horizon - no, it can’t be! Surely this must be a mirage! It’s a…hill! 
First hill I’ve seen in this country, let alone city. I race onwards to 
this ridge of high ground. Summit. Questions. Is this a real hill or man 
made? It rises unnaturally steeply and falls away as such on the other 
side. Lots of stonework about. I find an information board containing some 
old black and white photos of men with shovels, and an old vista showing 
how it used to look– something akin in style to the stretch down to the 
water at Versaille or in Vienna. I knew it was too good to be true. Time 
to head back. Sapped of energy given the cold. Just manage to limp home.</p>
