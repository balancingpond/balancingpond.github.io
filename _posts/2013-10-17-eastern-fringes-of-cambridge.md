If you look at a map of Cambridge, you will notice that the historic 
centre of the city is not in the geographical centre, but much further 
to the west, with vast suburbs mushrooming out to the east. My guess as 
to why this is would be primarily because the lands to the west of the 
city are largely College owned and so in some respects are protected green 
belt. Secondly because of the presence of the M11 which tightly skirts the 
western edge. Most students in the city seldom venture east, so I decided 
to take a look, and found some interesting sites...

One of my favourite types of walk is along long arterial roads - I like 
the way you don't need to concentrate on navigating, so can just switch 
off and absorb the scenery. I apply this technique on Cherry Hinton Road, 
which is my travelator into Eastern Cambridge. I emerge in the suburb of 
Cherry Hinton, one of the numerous villages swallowed up by Cambridge's 
relentless march east.

Here is the source of the Cherry Hinton Brook (later Coldham's Brook). 
Although Cambridge is often ridiculed for being flat, it is actually based
 at the foot of a chalk escarpment (lying to the south east), the very same
 which runs all the way through the Chilterns (Icknield Way) and down to the
 south coast (Ridgeway). As the chalk hits the impermeable clay of the low 
 lands, water is forced out in springs such as this one.

The chalk has a secondary purpose here - building material. Another thing 
you'll notice about Eastern Cambridge is that large chunks of it are 
missing. The whole areas is pocked with chalk pits, some now filled with 
water. Several of the colleges were built from this very chalk - material 
taken from the east to build the west. The largest is located close to the 
spring.

Stepping into the chalk pit is like stepping back in time 150 million 
years. In the chalk you can see coloured strata, successive eras being 
laid down on top of each other. Recent excavations revealed iron-age 
settlements here. Standing in the middle of the pit is slightly horrifying; 
I'm feeling like a pterodactyl might swoop down and carry me off at any 
moment...

Re-entering the present day on Limekiln Road, I decide to follow the Cherry 
Hinton Brook north through the Eastern Fringe. This takes me past two more 
huge chalk pits, disguised as great lakes. A lone Holiday Inn sparkles on 
the other side.

The Brook laces through suburbs and darts into an ever-narrowing allyway. 
Eventually I stumble out behind a Sainsbury's Superstore building and 
follow the brook through the carpark and onwards to Coldham's Common - a 
vast array of football and rugby pitches, the Hackney Marshes of Cambridge. 
Peering suspisciously over the bushes is a science park - this specie is 
ubiquitous on the Cambridge fringes; they radiate a paranoid energy into 
the landscape.

From the scrub in the north part of the common, I emerge into the car park 
of the Abbey Leisure Complex - a sublime piece of liminal architecture. In 
the words of Iain Sinclair "since when did leisure become so complex?".

The brook continues past the Cambridge United Stadium - I contemplate the 
footfall of hundreds of supporters on the little footbridge over the brook, 
unaware of the water and its chalky history, passing slowly below them. 
About a year after this walk, in a very rare event, top dogs Manchester 
Utd were invited to play against Cam Utd. It was a classic David vs Goliath 
moment - I don't remember who won, but I do remember the town swelling 
with Man-U fans on a Friday evening. I played pool with some of them in the 
Emporer on Hills Rd. They were pretty rowdy and possibly on drugs - the 
game was pretty tense, not because of the score, more because I thought I 
might get a pool cue to the head if I didn't play my balls right...

The brook now forms a buttcrack of green corridor between Barnwell and East 
Barnwell, which holds one of the jewels of the city: the Leper Chapel, 
founded 1125, one of Cambridge's oldest buildings. Today this sits on the 
busy A1134, Newmarket Road. It gave rise to Stourbridge fair on neighbouring 
Stourbridge common, which was one of the largest fairs in Medievel Europe.

Just before sunset I reach the confluence of the brook with the River Cam, 
a magical place to end a magical day.
