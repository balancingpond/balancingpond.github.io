    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>I embarked on this walk last year in April, a week after attending my grandfather’s funeral in Maidstone, Kent. My grandfather lived there happily with my 
grandmother for many years. I have many fond childhood memories of travelling to their’s in the back of my parent’s Citroen BX (later Toyota Carina) from our 
house in North London. Occaisonally we’d hoof it round the North Circular, A13, then Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. From here, staring down at the vast oil 
containers, I wondered what it would feel like to be down there staring back up at the vehicles high above on the bridge. But more often than not we’d drive via 
my dad’s work in Islington, then snake our way through Hackney picking up the A12 at Wick Rd. From here, as we approached the Blackwall Tunnel, I remember 
speeding passed Bromley-By-Bow tube station and remarking with my sister, “how on Earth can we still be in London?!” - this was miles from anywhere that was even 
vaguely familiar to us. So, you could understand my sister’s surprise when years later, on a separate walk to this one, I managed to walk here from our house in 
Ally Pally in a single morning. Leaving Bromley-By-Bow behind us we would descend into the Blackwall Tunnel, only to re-emerge into lands even more foreign and 
tantelising. As we surfaced on Bugsby Marshes, I remember craning my head in the late 90s to catch a glimpse of the Dome everyone was talking about going up 
behind us. Onwards then to Kidbrooke and through the Kidbrooke estate, which as far as I was concerned, was a remote outpost on the dark side of the Moon. I 
was fearful yet somehow enticed by it’s brutalist concrete structures and boarded up MDF windows. Beyond here, I was sure we were well out of London by now as 
the sign at the petrol station was for a place that I’m sure was up north somewhere - Mottingham. Even more unbeleivable it was then, when several miles of 
crampt dual carraige ways later (Eltham, Sidcup, Foot’s Cray), we at last ascended onto the M20 over a strange vale of woodland and I saw the “Welcome to Kent 
sign”. As I travelled this same route on the day of my Grandfather’s funeral, it occured to me that, not knowing anyone else in Kent, this may be the last time 
I ever travel through here. These unknown lands may remain unknown to me forever! Something had to be done. It was then, glancing out of my passenger seat 
window on the Swanley by-pass, that I vowed to find these places. My hope was that by walking to them on foot, they would become tangible, and an explorable 
part of the London I held in my mind…</p>

<p>It was on the Thursday evening before Good Friday that I drew up my plans. As well as the towns of the A20, I wanted to take in the areas under the Dartford 
Bridge (I had heard tales of a gargantuan pylon down there that I wanted to investigate). My plan was to get out there quickly on public transport then slowly 
work my way back into London. The quickest way was to get a train from King’s Cross along the brand new High Speed 1 line to Ebbsfleet International, out there 
somewhere in the Thames Esturay. From here I would walk to the Dartford Crossing, then up the Thames, taking the River Darent into the upper M20 corridor. From 
here I would work my way through south-east London, back home. So, early on Friday morning, I was hurled out of London and onto 
flat eluvial planes of the Thames Esturay…</p>

<p><strong>EBBSFLEET INTERNATIONAL</strong></p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>"There is no Ebbsfleet".</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What I came to realise about Ebbsfleet, is that not only is it not a place that lives up to the grandness implied in “International”, it isn’t actually a place 
at all. After being the only person to alight from the train here, I wonder out of the station into a barren landscape of endless empty car parks. I eventually 
get my barrings, and pass under a railway bridge and into Northfleet, an old dock town on the outskirts of Gravesend. As local Danielle, who worked in The 
Plough pub (now greasy spoon Golden Grill), put it in a 2008 interview to the BBC “There is no Ebbsfleet, it’s a train station and that’s it. That’s all 
Ebbsfleet is. There is no Ebbsfleet”. Ebbsfleet is in fact a planned development of 40000 new homes on brownfield site in the vicinity of Northfleet. Already in 
places there are veins of yellow houses worming their way through the brownfield. I follow a sign pointing me towards the Thames Path, behind some warehouses. 
Getting narrower, hope I don’t meet anyone. Eventually, I can take a passage on the left which opens out onto the docks, but passage is boarded off with silver 
sheet metal and signs “footpath closed, WARNING do not enter”. I see the huge bodies of decaying dockyard cranes behind the awning, suddenly I’m engulfed with 
an intense sense of agoraphobic doom…I try to control the panic and head back into Northfleet. This feeling is one that I get again at various points in this 
landscape - it is not one designed on the human scale, everything is massive - huge trucks, collosal tankers, vast open spaces, towering bridges and pylons. I 
head out west across the bridge and into Swanscombe, another perculiar Esturary town, and descend towards the Thames into an expansive landscape of rubble and 
weeds…</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>THAMES GATEWAY</strong></p>

<p>Ahead near the river I can see a pylon. It looks close, but it’s an optical illusion: this pylon is four times more massive than any I’ve ever seen. When I 
finally reach the base, I am standing next to something resembling the Eiffel Tower. On the far bank, there is it’s twin, with thick electrical cables 
connecting the two high above the river.</p>

   <figcaption><i>"Four times more massive than any I've ever seen".</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Onwards up stream to Greenhithe, past Ingress Abbey - built 1833, redeveloped by Crest circa 2002 (this is Deep Thames 
Gateway territory), the QEII bridge is getting ever closer. Eventually I am under the bridge, and again I am feeling like an ant about to be crushed. High above 
I hear the sound of endless streams of Tesco lorries vaulting the Thames. All I have for company down here is some rascist graffiti at the base of the concrete 
superstructure.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Queen Elizabeth The Second Bridge, the first bridge.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Moving on, I pass the Littlebrook Oil Fired Power Station and glimpse a fox through the mesh fence adorned with signs warning away those who 
have come in connection with the “Camp For Climate Action”.</p>

<figure>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Littlebrook (Oil Fired), fox.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the other side of the river I can see a massive tanker docked at Purfleet. There is a continuous 
stream of lorries surfacing from the hold. I watch for what seems like hours, transfixed, what on Earth could be inside all those containers? Coffins full of earth?</p>

<figure>
    <a href="https://imgur.com/HnCtXTZ">

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>What on Earth? (Coffins full of).</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally I move on, 
though the lorries continue. Further upstream I come across a guy fishing; broad, bald, pink shirt, large hands. His wife is 
set back from the river sun bathing. This seems like a nice spot for a leisurely bit of fishing, though I wonder why he’s the one here? A few yards upstream I 
find my answer: the infamous Southern Outfall, where everyone’s shit from Brixton to Barnehurst is spewed out into the Thames.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Everyone's shit (Brixton to Barnehurst).</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Further up river my path is 
blocked by the introusion of the river Darent, it’s flood defenses visible over the flat landscape. I cut inland across the flood plains, now in the heat of the 
day, and stumble upon some strange decaying concrete structures - reminents of some by-gone industrial process, or perhaps dwellings of an ancient civilization?</p>

   <figcaption><i>Darent flats - "dwellings of some ancient civilization".</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>THE CRAYS</strong></p>

<p>Having crossed the Darent I take a path passed a field full of junk being grazed by a couple of miserable donkies. I follow the Cray, a tidal tributary of the 
Darent choked with grey silt, past breaker’s yards, through Crayford and eventually come out in the grounds of Hall Place (founded 1537).</p>

<p>The gardens were very fine indeed, and I took a much needed rest in the hot houses.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Hall Place Hot House.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Onwards then to Bexley, and suddenly out into the countryside - I pass wondering chickens, riding schools, now into woods.</p>

<figure>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4QN0sUpl.jpg" alt="chicken" />
    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Chickens wonder.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I emerge on a high point on rural Parsonage Lane - in the distance I see a great road crossing the wide valley - the A20? Yes! So I am 
here, down here, down in that strange vale - I’ve done it, I have travelled to other Worlds! I can see myself on the bridge, starring out of the passenger 
seat. I worry that if we make eye contact the universe may implode, so I quickly dive behind a hedgerow and shelter until the vehicle is out of view. Unsettled 
by my encounter I hot-foot it to Foot’s Cr ay, where I take refuge in the Deep Bar &amp; Restaurant - a local hangout for Deep Topographers.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Deep Bar and Restaurant, for all your Deep Topographical needs.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Restored, I head down 
the A224 Cray Road only to be confronted by an impassable zone of roundabouts and roadside thickets - I have finally reached the A20. As a try to find a way 
through, wafts of punjent marajuana smoke emenate from an adjacent traveller site. Alas, there is no way through, and I am forced to trek west up the hard 
shoulder of the Sidcup-Bypass for about half a mile. I notice details that are not attainable at 60 mph: strange mock Tudor dwellings that can only be reached 
directly from the road side, unknown nature reserves (Scadbury Park). Finally I reach dry land at the Junction with the A222, work my way inland to MAIN ROAD, 
a long road taking me into further unknown suburbs.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Details not attainable at 60 mph.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>FURTHER UNKNOWN SUBURBS</strong></p>

<p>Somewhere on my trudge along here I pass into a trance…somewhere between New Eltham and Mottingham I am suddenly struck with hunger. The options aren’t 
looking great. I settle for an Indian take-away near the petrol station. My feet are sore now and the sun is starting to retreat. Huddled under a raincoat, I 
tuck in to my fluorescent chicken-tikka massala in some municipal park, hoping no one sees me. I have a quick check of the A-Z and head on through Eltham. 
Eventually I see something familiar - the Kidbrooke Estate. I have come at an interesting time - the whole estate is under massive redevelopment - the old Moon 
base is being replaced by something more hi-tech - dwellings fit for 21st century living. There are only a few of the old buildings left standing.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Moon base, Kidbrooke.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This place 
doesn’t feel safe, - I pick my way through half demolished council blocks, searching for a way out - I take my chances down a narrow allyway hoping I don’t meet 
anyone. I’m nearly at the out when my heart sinks - I hear voices coming from the other end - with no choice I plough on. As emerge from the other end ready to 
run, I almost collide with two prams being pushed by a pair of yummy mummys.</p>

<p><strong>WORMHOLE</strong></p>

<p>I seem to have fallen through some sort of worm-hole and landed in Hampstead. The streets are lined with Jaguars and 4x4s. The houses are detached and have 
columns. Where am I? As I walk down the leavy street, I consult my A-Z. It appears I am in Blackheath. The Highgate of the South.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Wormhole.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As twilight approaches, I 
climb up to the heath, another site connected to the Camp For Climate Action, and gaze out across the city. I am planning to meet a friend in Brixton Market for 
a drink later.</p>

    </a>
   <figcaption><i>Twilight on the Heath.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having come this far by foot, I resolve to make Brixton by 9pm. I set off west down Shooter’s Hill, sticking to the main road all the way as it 
lacings through the inner-city districts of South London. As I recall, somewhere around Deptford a large blister on my ankle popped, considerably slowing 
progress. Somehow I limped on, and reached the market before 10pm, being just over 30 miles from Northfleet. In the days afterwards, both of the nails on my big 
toes turned black. I have since bought new walking boots.</p>
